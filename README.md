🧠 Problem Statement
Given the data of passengers aboard the Titanic, predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, ticket class, etc.

📊 Features Used
Pclass (Ticket class)

Sex

Age

SibSp (No. of siblings/spouses aboard)

Parch (No. of parents/children aboard)

Fare

Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

🧹 Preprocessing Steps
Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling

Feature selection

🤖 Models Used
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost (optional)
